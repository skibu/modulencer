# idfx_src directory
This directory is for source code that will likely eventually be put into the idfx comonent library, but
for now is part of the main software so that it is easier to develop. Nice thing about this structure is
that the file structure is identical to that of the idfx componenet, so include names won't have to be
changed when code is moved to the idfx component.

Note: this is configured in the top level CMakeLists.txt file.
