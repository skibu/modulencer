# Modulencer
The goal is to create a combination mulation tool and sequencer (hence, "modulencer") eurorack module that is different from the rest.

## Initial goals
 * Be user interface oriented. Complicated features, yet easy to use.
 * Explore and use newish tools
 * Open-source so that others can contribute
 * Cheap and DIY so that others can use it
 * Expandable. Can incrementally add new functionality or sequencer types
 * Eurorack modular. For controlling other sound generating devices beyond just synths
 * Provide both 1v/oct and CV outputs
 * Multiple outputs plus MIDI to create & control multiple voices

Components
 * large color touch screen. Provices maximum flexibility for UI. And such displays now available.
 * ESP32 since there is so much capability at low cost

## Status
At the very start, the jotting down of ideas stage
