# Jack Colors

want each jack to have a RGB LED to indicate current input or output. not just the value of the voltage, but also 
what the voltage represents (gate, trigger, 1v/oct, etc). Since the modulencer will have many jacks, and 
most of the jacks can handle different signal types,  this could really 
help user keep track of what they are doing. 

## Proposed colors
Note: Since dealing with many different types, not going to use different colors for inputs and outputs. 

| Function | Color | Voltage Range | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Gate     | ${\textsf{\color{orange}ffa500 Orange}}$| 0 or 10V | Voltage is binary - high or low |
| Trigger  | ${\textsf{\color{red}ff0000 Red}}$      | 0 or 10V | Momentary voltage spike. Voltage is binary |


## Buchla colors
Buchla synths use colored jacks to indicate their purpose. these colors are described in 
the [Buchla 200h Users Guide](https://buchla.com/guides/200h_Users_Guide_v0.9.pdf) and are dis-layed below.
but these colors represent just a couple of functions, plus they are not consistently used Therefore
not using them for Modulencee.
