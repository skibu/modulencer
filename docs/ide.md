# IDE

Since this is a micro-controller project it completely makes sense to use PlatformIO within Visiual Studio Code (aka VSCode). 
The Arduino IDE is a possibile environment, but it is now really just for beginners and it doesn't offer the capabilities of a real IDE.

Simply go to https://platformIO.org, download VSCode, run it, and then load PlatformIO as an add on.
